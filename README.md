Maine state trivia on demand.

### Inspiration

I wrote this application for a party where almost half the guests grew up in Maine. I posted the URL on a sign and people accessed the app and shared random facts throughout the night. It was fun, especially when the data was incoherent.

Besides entertainment, my motivation here was to see how quickly I could come up with an idea, build it (using TDD, without scaffolding or a template), and deploy. It took about forty minutes from start to finish.

The data is scraped from Wikipedia's [Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine) page.
